//In order to create a new object you have to write a class that "defines" it. In this way you can think of this as adding a new keyword to Java, but to do so you have to tell Java what this keyword means. Here's how we would define a "Student" object that includes all the variables from the example above:

public class Student {
    // fields
    String name;
    int grad;
    int ID;
    double GPA;
    int abs;

    // constructor
    public Student(String name, int grad, int ID, double GPA, int abs) {
        this.name = name;
        this.grad = grad;
        this.ID = ID;
        this.GPA = GPA;
        this.abs = abs;
    }

    // behavior
    public boolean isGraduating() {
        return (GPA > 2.0 && abs < 10 && grad == 12);
    }
}
//Notice that this class does not have a main method. That is because this code cannot be executed by itself, but must instead be invoked by a different class that does have a main method.
